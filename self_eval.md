# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  * The only thing I struggled with was iterating over the last hash provided- login statuses. I got it to work, but then I changed something and broke it.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  * Note taking is going very well. I have separate word documents for each lesson. I have found that I take the most helpful notes when watching someone else do something or doing something myself.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  * I try to do it myself first, but I am quick to Google if I get stuck.
